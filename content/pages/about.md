I am Binh Lam, go by Cindy, born in Vietnam and ethnically Chinese. I am a developer and a curious learner with a great interest in 3D Web as well as AR applications. 
<!-- I like building both iOS and Android applications. They are both really fun and interesting to me.  -->
I really hope to be able to slowly master all the above libraries, frameworks, and their associated languages. This blog will be documenting my personal learning progress and excitement for any new tech discovery, and hopefully it might help you too!

哈囉！我的中文名是林鈺屏，叫我Cindy就可以了，我是越南華僑。

我是一名程序員也是一位充滿好奇心的學生，對於 3D Web 和 AR 軟件都非常的感興趣。
<!-- 我喜歡 iOS 和 Android 的程序，沒偏見，只覺得它們都很有趣，好玩。 -->

我希望把我感興趣的程序及邊碼語言慢慢的掌握得更好。我會用這部落格來分享我的學習進度還有研究到的新玩(創)意，希望你也從中找到對你有幫助的東西！
