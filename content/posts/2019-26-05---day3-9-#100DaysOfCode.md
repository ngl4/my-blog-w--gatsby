---

In general, this week I would say the progress is a little slower than I thought. I want to try different styles of learning each week to see what might be more efficient for me. This week, I **set a different topic to focus on learning each day**, For example, on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, I would be focusing on doing more coding challenges on Hackerrank and relearning JavaScript on FreeCodeCamp. Then, on Tuesday and Thursday, I would be working on AR materials (with Unity and Three.js). On Friday and Sunday, I need to work on some project ideas. 

However, I find this method is slightly ineffective. It is **hard to predict the unexpected events** that will happen each day. You might need to spend more hours on a certain event than you have previously planned. Another problem is once you get distracted for the day and you do not finish the tasks that you are supposed to finish. Then, they will **get push off to the next day**. The biggest problem is my goals -- I might have set them too high and out of reach. Another issue is the learning method. 

I decide to change the learning strategy slightly. Instead of planning to work on a different topic each day, I will **focus on a topic for at least 2-3 days**, depends on the daily goals I set for myself. I will keep you up to date possibly in two weeks to see if this method actually works or not. 

*I will be attending a Hackathon event for 5 days starting in the upcoming weekend. So I will update my weekly progress on Thursday, May 30th, instead of Sunday* 

### Day 3

**Second Meeting with Cody Casey** -- I met with Cody to work through two Hackerrank coding challenges. It was so great to see how the same codes to be written differently and more efficient. Also, I learned more about EsLint as well. 

  ####Progress:

  * Hackerrank Warm-Up Challenges: Finish them and Rewrite some codes. (3/4) Done. The Repeated String challenge still has not passed through all test cases yet. 

  * FCC: ES6 (2/4) Done. 

### Day 4

  ####Progress:

  * Learning AR with Unity: I am going through a Udemy tutorial on *[Build Your Instagram AR Portal With ARCore & ARKit](https://www.udemy.com/learn-arcore-and-arkit-by-building-your-instagram-ar-portal/)* -- I have successfully build the basic portal room as well as implementing ARFoundation and building ARKit app. However, I have been having some issues with black-screen issue - still debugging.

### Day 5

**Philadelphia JavaScript Developers Meetup Event**  

* [Kelley Robinson](https://twitter.com/kelleyrobinson) had a great talk on Two-Factors Authentication-- mentioned SMS 2FA (SS7 vulnerabilities & SIM Swapping), Yubikey, TOTP (Time-based One Time Password), and 2FA model (from Required Token Based 2FA, Required 2FA, to Optional 2FA). 

* [Ryan Yurkanin](https://twitter.com/YurkaninRyan) also had a great talk on Algebraic Effects in JavaScript. You can find out more about the contents [here](https://tkplaceholder.io/algebraic-effects-help-us-optimize-for-change/). 

####Progress:

  * Hackerrank Array Coding Challenge: (1/4) Done. Taken me a while, but I think I am getting better this time. I actually get pretty close to the answer. I then read about how other people solve the same problem and find [this article](https://medium.com/@mannycodes/how-to-solve-the-2d-array-hourglass-code-challenge-15389fdf77b5) by [Manny Codes](https://medium.com/@mannycodes) to be the most helpful. 

  * FCC: ES6 (3/4) Done.


### Day 6

  Today, I got the least amount of work done. I was assisting a family member for half of the day and was exhausted by the end of the day. 

  ####Progress:

  * Learning AR with Unity: trying to debug the black-screen issue. Still not solved. 


### Day 7

  ####Progress:

  * Three.js: Add 3D model to Three.js page. The issue of adding a 3D model in glTF file to the page is the problem that I have not solved completely from a previous github repo. Today, after digging through the issue for hours, thanks to the [David Lyons](https://twitter.com/davidxlyons)'s guidance, I just need to uncomment one line of the code and it finally works!!!

  * FCC: ES6 All Done. 


### Day 8

Today, I went to an event with my sister and a friend. This was planned before this 100DaysOfCode Challenge, but It was such a wonderful stress-relief day! 

  ####Progress:

  * No Progress. 


### Day 9

  ####Progress:

  * FCC: Regular Expressions All Done. 

  * Project: Write down my ideas for personal Full Stack Applications and do some research on those ideas.

  * Read Clean Code Book. 


*The goal for next week will be focusing on the full stack project, Hackerrank & FCC, and hopefully I will be able to solve the black-screen issue for the AR app*  

#Quote For the Week: 

> There is an amazing power getting to know your inner self and learning how to use it and not fight with the world. If you know what makes you happy, your personality, interests and capabilities, just use them, and everything else flows beautifully.
