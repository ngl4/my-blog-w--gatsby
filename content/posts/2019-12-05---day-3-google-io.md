## Codelabs

![io-day3-entrance](/media/google-io-2019/io-day3-entrance.jpg) 

Early in the morning, I decided to stay at the Codelabs to finish all of the AR codelabs. All of these codelabs needed to be done in Android Studio. Having an Android phone/tab is needed to test applications.

At the end, It took me slightly longer than I expected to finish the AR codelabs -- [Introduction to Sceneform](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sceneform-intro/#0), [ARCore Cloud Anchors](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/arcore-cloud-anchors/#0), [AR Faces](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/augmented-faces-with-sceneform/#0), but I got them all done! I also did one Flutter codelab called [Adding Google Maps to a Flutter App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-in-flutter/#0). They are all super fun to do! And finger-crossed for the 2020 ticket. 

By the way, if you are working through these codelabs and run into isssues, feel free to reach out to me.

# Sessions

### Google Search and JavaScript Sites

### Mindfulness Workshop - The importance of Digital Wellbeing

![io-mindfulness-workshop](/media/google-io-2019/io-mindfulness-workshop.jpg) 

During the Mindfulness Workshop, we were asked to put away our phone and so I did not take a lot of pictures of the workshop. Basically we were doing meditating and reflecting on ourselves. It was super helpful after the intensity of the three days conference. 

# Sandboxes

### Sandbox G: ML + AI 

  #### >>> [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)
  
  Another great resource I found at the TensorFlow stand which may be helpful for your web development: [WebAudio.js](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/webaudio.js/)

  ![io-sandbox-tensorflow](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-tensorflow.jpg) 


  #### >>> [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)

  ![io-sandbox-ai-mobile-iot](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-ai-mobile-iot.jpg) 


  #### >>> [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/)

  ![io-sandbox-ml-kit](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-ml-kit.jpg) 


  #### >>> [Google AI Perception and AI Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/acoustic-detection-of-humpback-whales.html)

  ![io-sandbox-AI-research](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-AI-research.jpg) 


  #### >>> [Google AI Impact Challenge](https://www.google.org/our-work/google-impact-challenge/)

  Before I left the sandbox, I talked to Mollie Javerbaum, a Product Strategist @ Google, about a AstApp (prototype), which was built to test and analyzed how antibiotics influenced on individuals.

## Key Takeaways

**1.** *[Specifically for First-Timer]* **Don't Miss Out Codelabs and Sandboxes!** 

  For Codelabs, you can try to do them at home before you go to the conference. If you finish four of them, you get the chance to enter the lottery of possibly winning a free ticket to the 2020 Google I/O Conference -- You have to get 4 stickers from Google employees at the Codelabs area. 
  
  **The Codelabs area at the conference is least crowded on the first day**, and most crowded on second and third day. 

  As for Sandboxes, you can have a lot of fun there, In my personal experience, I spent a lot of times in Sandboxes. I would suggest to leave **more times on the 2nd and 3rd days to explore each one of the sandboxes**. 


**2. Have 1-2 Great Connections** 

  You do not have to be friends with everyone at the conference, but you can always build a closer connection with only one or two new friends you made at the conference. Sometimes, **Less is More**.  


**3. Stay in touch with New/Old friends**
  
  When we leave the conference and going back to our daily life, remember to stay in touch with all the new friends you make. **Don't let them forget you and don't let you forget them.**

  Last but not least, special thanks to **Dicko Sow**, my roommate at the conference period, and a Full Stack Developer, for all of your accompany and encouragement. We always discussed about our experience at the end of each day and those discussion always made a wonderful conclusion for each day at the conference. I have learned a lot from you and will work hard toward the way. Thank you! 


*This 2019 Google I/O Conference was so meaningful to me. I have met a lot of amazing speakers, professionals, and new friends who inspired me tremendously. Thank you for all of your guidance, enthusiasm, and inspiration and I am super excited and looking forward to seeing you all again in more upcoming events or conferences*
 
**Stay in Touch, Friends!**
