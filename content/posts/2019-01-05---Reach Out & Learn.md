## Today's Accomplishments: 

**Coding Challenge Strategies** -- Today, I have learned a lot after meeting with Cody Casey, Software Engineer at Guru, who had walked through a coding challenge step-by-step with me. I just want to share some strategies I found. I want myself to get into a habit to use them more to battle against all the hard coding challenges (and of course I hope these strategies may help you out, too): 

  **Before Starting to Code**

  1. *Read + Explain + Identify* 

      Due to the time limit for each coding question, this step might need to be done within a few minutes, but it is a really crucial one. 

      It is important to **read** through the problem line-by-line. Then you can try to **explain** to yourself, such as what the problem is and what is the expected solution. Next, **identify** all the input values/elements, array(s), and limitations (ie, range limitation for the size of the elements and arrays ---> depends on the question, this might be needed for writing an efficient algorithm)


  2. *Visualize the problem using simpler inputs*

      Sometimes it can be hard to understand the problem entirely with a large input elements. So start off in a **simpler** scale. For instance, instead of using an array this long [2,5,6,8,9,0,5,3,2,4,5,4,8], try a shorter one like this [3,4,8,2,1] or even like this [3,7]. This will all depend on the problem. 
      
      Besides, making it simplier, if you like to *see* the problems -- like me, I like to tackle problems by drawing on paper, it will be a great idea to always have papers or a whiteboard ready with you while going through coding challenges. 

  *Key: rememeber to pseudo-code before you start coding*

  **During the Coding Process**
  
  3. *Break down the problems as small as possible*

      This is the **KEY** to solving any coding challenges no matter how complicated they are. Break them down into smaller pieces and then tackle each small problems, one at a time. 

  4. *Create a boolean or variable to replace any small problem that you want to tackle later*

      Cody taught me this and I think it is super smart. When you are going through each small problem and suddenly encounter one that you are not so sure how to solve, **create a boolean or variable** as something like, "AddChangesLater" or anything you can think of to remind you to come back to this small problem later. 

  **Before Submitting your Codes**

  5. *Skim through the instruction and check whether you have fulfilled all the requirements*

      It is always good to double check your codes and see if there is anything missing. It is always important to think about the efficiency of the algorithm you have implemented and whether all your elements, variables or array are set in the required range of the problem. 

  6. (Optional-when you have extra time) *Find a more efficient way to solve the problem* 

      This is the part that you might need to think about Big O and how efficient is your function. Is there a better way to do it (with less steps)?

      I really hope to get to this stage, but I am not sure when. As long as I do not give up, I will get here. So do you. Believe in yourself! 


  **After Submitting your Codes**

  7. *CELEBRATE* 

      You have done your best to battle your enemy/enemies. Give yourself a reward!

  8. *Practice, Practice, Practice, Practice*

      Once you are done celebrating, it is important to get back to the battle field again. 

      An advice I got from Nelly Sugu, Full Stack Developer at Wayfair, really simple but crucial, **Practice, Practice, Practice, Practice**
