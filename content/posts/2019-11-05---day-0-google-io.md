## Badge Pick Up 

  Once I got off the plane, I took the Bart train and Caltrain to get to Mountain View. Along the way, I am fortunate to meet **Johnathan Friesen**, an Android developer from Vancouver (also going to the Google I/O conference). We basically worked together to navigate through the public transportation. There was not enough clear signage to navigate around the train stations, especially it can be slightly frustrated for newcomers to navigate through the area by themselves.

  Once we got to Mountain View Caltrain station, we took the **Google I/O Shuttle** to get to the Shoreline Amphitheatre. 


  Unlike a lot of articles I had read from other attendees' past years conference experience, this year, there was no long line. I went in to check in and got my badge within **10 minutes** or less. 

  Then, I went to get lunch at Mountain View with Johnathan Friesen and **Frances Cooper**, a Computer Science PhD student from UK who will be interning at Google soon. We had great conversation about the conference and our experience. 

  One side note, I really appreciated being able to meet different people along my way to and back from the badge pick up. No matter where you are, many interesting and bright people might be just right around you. But somehow, you might not have not noticed them. It has been great meeting you, **Carlos Chavez and Gilbert**.

## Women Techmakers Dinner 

  In the evening period, I met up with **Priya Shah** (an Android developer @ IFTTT in SF), **Hadiya Firdaus** (a software engineer and a student with interest and experience in AR/VR development & data visualization from Canada), **Esraa Salah Elewa** (an Android developer @ Swvl in Egypt), and **Dora Racca** (a developer and research assistant in Bioengineering from Argentina) in San Francisco. Then, we took a Lyft shared ride together to attend the Women Techmakers Dinner at Sunnyvale, CA. We had such a great conversation and accompanied each other at the event. It is my pleasure to be able to know them individually. They are inspirational and strong women! 


  At the WTM dinner, there were music, photo booths, games, and foods at the venue. **For those who did not get their badges at the shoreline,they can get them at the dinner event.** 
  
  I found this super cute and heavy **pepper salt container**. There are real pepper and salt in there. 


  Surprisingly, I even met an Udemy and App Brewery instructor, **Angela Yu**. I bought her courses to learn coding in the past and they were really helpful for me. Find out more about her courses [here](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/). 


## Key Takeaways 

  1. **Pick Up Your Badge Early at the Shoreline** -- You can get this at WTM dinner, but the line will be super long. I would suggest you get it from the Shoreline before going to WTM dinner if you can.

  2.  **(Women Specific) Connect with new friends in the WTM Slack Channel** -- Always get shared rides because you will get discount/promo code for Lyft and Uber. 

  3. **Ask** -- I personally find "asking" is a powerful communication tool for you to talk with another individual and to connect with them. When you ask, you show your curiosity to want to know more about them. Give this a try, and let me know if it works for you.
