This time, I travelled with my younger sister, My, who has always wanted to tag along whenever I travel. First of all, I would like to specially thanks my friends, Joya and Faith (& Faith's mother), who had welcomed us and showed us around their hometowns, nearby suburbans, as well as Washington D.C. This trip would not have been fun without their companions and guidance. Thank you so much for making our trip at Maryland and D.C so wonderful and knowledgable!

#### Day 1 - Philly -> Baltimore -> Seabrook -> Lanham

I and my sister caught an early bus to Baltimore. We arrived at around 10am. After that, we took an Uber to get to Inner Habour. The Uber driver was super nice and he dropped us off at the Visitor Center. We got a map there for our travel reference. At first, we thought about visiting the Maryland Science Center, but we decided later to go to get some food. We went to Brown Rice Korean Grill to get some customized Bibimbap for lunch. The food was really tasty. I would say it is like Chipotle/Qdoba business style.

After lunch, we knew our goal was to walk all the way to the Penn Station to catch the MARC train to Seabrook station, where my friend, Joya, is at. Along the way, we took a lot of pictures of the buildings and streets of Baltimore. We also went to the Warner's Art Museum and got the chance to talk to an Art Conservator, Pam, about how she would _conserve_ all the old artworks. Through Infrared and X-ray, we could see how painters originally drew and set grids for each painting. She worked at this job for 19 years and she loves her job. It can be hard to find a job that you love, and she is the lucky one.

Leaving Warner's Museum, we walked for around a few minutes and stopped by Minato Sushi Bar for some snacks. We had Shirmp Tempura, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll, and an Avocado Salad. It was really good and blew our minds.

After around 20 minutes, we got to the Penn Station. It was slightly tired to walk with our one small suitcase and our backpacks, but we did it!

The train to Seabrook was around 35 minutes long. My friend, Joya, came to pick us up and we had a night stay at her house. Joya brought us out to dinner at Uncle Julio. The _Guamula_ is super amazing! It has been the best _Guagomoli_ that I have so far.

Then, Joya rode us around Annapolis to have a look at the environment at the capital of Maryland. That was it for the first day trip! I love how we walked miles and ate delicious foods along the way. Thank you Joya and family to allow us to stayover for one night!!

#### Day 2 - Lanham -> Greenbelt -> D.C -> Germantown and Gaithersburg

I had reached out to my another close friend, Faith, who lived in Germantown, MD. We decided to meetup at D.C. and then we would go to her hometown. Joya went out with us and drove to Greenbelt to catch the Metro subway to get to D.C. As Joya suggested, taking the Metro is better than driving to D.C, you can then avoid the heavy traffic. We took the Yellow/Green Line to Galaxy Place where the Chinatown is at. We got lunch at _rere_ and we had ramen, Shanghai Soup Bao, and Pork Buns.

We took the subway to the Washington Monumnet\* and we helped a PhD student for his research paper survey on transportation in D.C. area. We got the Capital Bikeshare and drove around the area slightly. Around less than 20 minutes, we need to stop riding because it suddenly rained. Change of plan - we decided to catch the subway to get to Metro City to meet up with my friend, Faith.

We said goodbye to Joya after getting back to Greenbelt. We got our luggage and then we took the subway again to get to Shady Grove (the opposite side of Greenbelf) and this time with my friend, Faith. It took around 45-50 minutes to get to Shady Grove. Faith's mother came over to the station to pick all of us up. Really Thank you Faith and her mother for letting us to stay over for one night!

Faith took us out to dinner at Ziki Japanese Steakhouse. It was a really interesting dinner. It was the first time for all of us to have Hibashi.

We then went to AMC to watch a movie, "Men In Black: International."

We went for a short walk around the AMC building until the rains and thunders came again after a few minutes to urge us to go home. We did not walk as much as we did in Day 1 at Baltimore, but we had a great time chatting with my friends, Joya and Faith.

#### Day 3 - Silver Spring, -> D.C -> Philly

Faith and her mother brought us to their Church at Silver Spring, MD. It was a Children Takeover Day where children were performing on stage, singing, acting, and dancing about the bible. They were really cute and they had practiced for six months for all the performances on this children takeover day. After chidlren performances, there was a talk on Friendship. What is a friendship? The speaker stated one point about the importance of friendship is to make friends with those who share the same values and goals, because this can influence both you and your friends' destinies. It was slightly funny that it did put me on the spot to analyze and think about the meanings behind freindship while being on a trip visiting my friends.

The church was really welcoming for new guests. We met with Folake who introduced us about the Church and gave us some treats for coming to Church event for the first time.

After Church event, Faith's mother dropped us off with Faith at the Metro station at Silver Spring. We said goodbye to Faith's mother here. Thank you for taking care of us.

We and Faith took the Metro subway to D.C. and we went to get some food at Batham King. The ramen is soso here.

After the late lunch, we walked to the National Gallery of Art. We went through two floors and because it would close at around 6pm, we decided to leave early anyway to get to the Union Station. We had a long chatting time together while having some croissants. Then, we said goodbye to Faith here.

The bus was delayed and we got home at around 2am.
