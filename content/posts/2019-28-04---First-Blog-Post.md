I am super excited to have my own professional/personal blog. This blog will be sharing a variety of things I discover with the focus on tech mainly. 

Here are a list of reasons that I would hope to accomplish with this blog: 
1. Keep track of my learning progress for Coding Interview (Algorithms and Data Structure) -- temporarily 
2. Share interesting CSS, 3D, WebGL, Unity, AR features that I have learned from other developers and designers
3. Show some guidances on anything that took me a lot of time to solve (maybe it can help you to save your time from debugging)

I am excited for this first blog post. Yay!
