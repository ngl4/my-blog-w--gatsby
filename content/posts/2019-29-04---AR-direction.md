***Today's Accomplishments:*** 

1. **Big O Notation** -- Watching through [UC Berkeley Big O (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_VIS4YDpuP98) and [Orders of Growth (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithmic-thinking-1/orders-of-growth-6PKkX) to get a better understanding of the Big O notation concept. 

Key Note of the Day: "O" stands for *Order*. 

2. **Google ARCore Sceneform** -- Going through one of the Google I/O Codelabs on AR, I have been able to go through it pretty well, until I get to the testing stage. I need an android device to run the testing. --> no worries, I will make sure I have a device to keep working on this Codelab activity. 

3. **Set Directions to build some fun AR apps** -- I will start off learning AR concepts and building-apps-activities through some Udemy courses. I will definitely share the courses that I find really helpful and useful in the future blog. So stay tuned! 

Though I have not created something interesting today, I find great resources and have an AR idea to start with. I will keep this idea as a secret for now. 

Besides learning and building AR apps, I will keep learning Algorithms and Data Structure to prepare myself for future Technical Assessments.
