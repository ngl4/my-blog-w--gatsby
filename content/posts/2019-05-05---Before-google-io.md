description: "How do I find a way to go to Google I/O Conference?"
---

On April 19th, I got an email from LeeAnn Kinney, Director of Programs of [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/) (a nonprofit organization for adult women in learning web and software development), about an opportunity going to Google I/O conference. I paid for the conference with an access code provided by the director, and so I only had to pay the academic ticket cost, instead of the general ticket cost. 

Besides the ticket cost, I also applied for the Women Techmakers Travel Grants, which could be extremely helpful to pay for the travelling and living expenses for my stay in San Francisco, which was financially challenging to me. Fortunately, on May 2nd, I got an email from LeeAnn informing me that I would be receiving a travel grant, which had helped me to pay all of my travelling and living expenses. 

Since it was my first time going to the California, I decided to reach out to the Women Techmakers community and GDI Philly community through slack channels to ask if anyone would need a roommate. Luckily, Dicko Sow, my roommate during the stay at the conference, reached out to me about it. Through her connection, we were able to find a better place to stay at San Francisco, which was only 3 minutes away from the Shuttle Pick Up Spot. I am really glad to have known Dicko. We have been sharing our stories, experience, and reflection after each day at the conference. 

I am sharing with you how I find my way to go to Google I/O Conference. Most importantly, what I really want to get across is: 

1. Always reach out to your local Meetup or community group, you will never know sometimes you might get the opportunity or get to know someone you have not thought of before. 

2. Dare to think and dare to take action toward your way - you may or may not find luck, but you definitely will find more and relevant opportunities and people heading along with you in your life/career direction. 

If you have any questions or concern, feel free to reach out to me. 

Last but not least, I want to sincerely thank GDI Group for providing me this great learning and networking opportunity at Google I/O conference!
