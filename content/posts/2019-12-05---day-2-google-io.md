## A New Friend 

At the beginning of second day, I made a new friend, Ruei-Fong Lyu, a PHP developer and a student from Taiwan. We spent time together to explore different sandboxes and sessions in the last two days of the conference. After meeting Ruei-Fong, my whole schedule for my 2nd and 3rd days have changed. I decided to spend more times visiting more sandboxes than going to sessions.

## Glen Keane's Inspirational Talk

Here are some of the moments at Glen's talk that spark me:

Besides Glen's session, I had also been to some other sessions throughout the day, but I mainly went to explore the Sandboxes, because they were super fun!!!

## Sandboxes 

For sandboxes, I would list out some of the resources that I found interesting, but there are definitely more than what I have listed below:  

### Sandbox A: Web + Chrome OS + Payments

  #### >>> [AMP Dev](https://amp.dev/)

  #### >>> [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)

  ![io-sandbox-amp-search](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-amp-search.jpg) 

  #### >>> [Security & Authentication](https://developers.google.com/identity/)

  I have talked to **Eiji Kitamura**, Developer Advocate @ Google, who explained to me a lot about authentication. I still have a lot I do not understand and it is best for me to dig into the documentation to learn about it. 

  #### >>> [Google Payment](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/pay-web-checkout/index.html?index=..%2F..index#1)

### Sandbox B: AR + Flutter

  #### >>> [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

  #### >>> [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/)

  ![io-sandbox-AR-4](/media/google-io-2019/io-sandbox-AR-4.jpg) 

### Sandbox C: Android

  #### >>> [Kotlin Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-android-training-welcome/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

  #### >>> [Kotlin For Beginner](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011)

  ![io-kotlin-manuel](/media/google-io-2019/io-kotlin-manuel.jpg) 

### Sandbox H: Assistant 

  #### >>> [Google Assistant](https://developers.google.com/actions/)

## Office Hour

  ![io-office-hour-app-review-1](/media/google-io-2019/io-office-hour-app-review-1.jpg) 

  ![io-office-hour-app-review-2](/media/google-io-2019/io-office-hour-app-review-2.jpg) 

  ![io-office-hour-demian](/media/google-io-2019/io-office-hour-demian.jpg) 

  During the office hour, Demian Rensullie, Senior Mobile Solutions Engineer @ Google, was my tutor. What I learned from him was to understand the performance of my own website using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools),  [Audits](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/audit/), which can be found in the Google Console. This can be extremely helpful to check the performance of your web page. Give this a try if this is new to you!!

## Short film & Concert 

  #### Film Screening: nimiia cetii, an Art and Machine Learning Project by Artist Jenna Sutela

  ![io-film-screening](/media/google-io-2019/io-film-screening.jpg)  


  #### Yacht and The Flaming Lips! Concert

  ![io-concert](/media/google-io-2019/io-concert.jpg) 

  I only saw the Yacht band performance and was too tired to wait until the Flaming Lips! band to start performing. But, if you are interested, [Here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23io19%20concert&src=typd&lang=en) is some more images and info about the concert. 

## Key Takeaways

**1.** *[Specially for future First-Timer]* **Visit as many "Sandboxes" as you could on the 2nd and 3rd days of the conference**

**2. Explore new language, framework, or anything you are not familiar with -- they might spark a new idea for a future project**

  *You will never know how interesting are the unknown, until you give it a try!*
