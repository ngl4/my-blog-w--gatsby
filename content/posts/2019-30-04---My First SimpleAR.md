***Today's Accomplishments:*** 

1. **Big O Notation** -- Watching through [Asymptotics (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithmic-thinking-1/asymptotics-bXAtM) for the first time. I really do not understand what is going on. But it is ok. I will rewatch it again to slowly figure out Asymptotic Notations.  

2. **ARCore vs ARKit** -- So glad to be able to learn about ARCore (offered by Google) and ARKit (brought by Apple). They are super amazing. [Here](https://medium.com/@knapenkjell/arcore-vs-arkit-ee0780c33b69) is a great resource for you to understand the difference between them. 

  *Great News*: Today, Through the [this](https://www.udemy.com/learn-arcore-and-arkit-by-building-your-instagram-ar-portal/) Udemy Course, I am able to create my own really simple AR mobile application on my iOS device. It is built with Unity and I have used the [ARFoundation Samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples) documentation.
