**The HSX MarketStreet Hackathon: The Consumer Consent Edition** was an approximately five days of intense Hackathon with the focus on not just the technical aspects, but more importantly the medical/business idea. 

I participated in the Hackathon with a fresh mindset to open up myself to new knowledge and experience, and I ended up learning more than I thought and also have been able to make some really **amazing connections**. 

Speacial Thanks to the Hackathon mentor, **Samuel Ayisi**, who had asked us a lot of questions and also given us a lot of support and suggestions. Also, Super thankful to **all the staff at HSX MarketStreet**. I personally also want to thank **Josh Raymond** who had given me some technical guidance about OAuth2 on the first day of the Hackathon.

Last Friday, I walked up to a table and met three bright individuals, **Jessica Zhou**, **Sreeram Penna**, and **Kristen Nicholson**. Since then, we have become a super-power team and I could not imagine how wonderful the entire Hackathon experience we have been through together.

When I joined the group, I noticed the team had already got a pretty solid direction for the idea. 

**Jessica** came up with this idea of building an application for chronic pain patients by incorporating pain tracking method with cognitive behavior therapy. After meeting up with Sreeram and Kristen, as a whole, they had combined Jessica's idea with an additional medication logging feature using HSX Patients API.

After joinning the team, I worked closely with Kristen on the application development. Jessica has built a simple prototype using Swift, which is well function and creative. Her UI design is minimalist and easy to use. Kristen and I were helping to add some more elements, such as chart and medication list. Kristen uses R programming and I use JavaScript. We decided to focus on one language -- R, since Kristen had already built the back-end for the application. So, I ended up writing JavaScript codes and send them to her to integrate with her R codes. 

**Kristen** also added more functionalities to Jessica's UI designs using R by overlaying all the R codes underneath the UI design. I have definitely learned more about the language integration between R and JavaScript and had an extremely great experience pair-programming with her. 

**Sreeram** has always been really encouraging in our group. He would also be there to listen to the presentation and discuss the business aspect of the application. He created the user-story for the team to enhance the technical development of the app. He would always be available to answer any questions we had within the team.

There were a total of six teams participated initially. However, there were only four teams that stayed to the end of the Hackathon. **Jessica represented our team to present on stage and demo the PainLess prototype app.** She had done a phenomenal job!

**Three other teams** also did super well on their presentations -- **SalvareX** (Data Platform to address challenges in Rare Diseases), **Intake** (Incorporates Alexa in solving patient admission and discharge inefficiency), **Healthy For Me!** (Recipe search based on patient data)

Unexpectedly, and really unexpectedly, as a team, we received **First place** and won some extra cash $$$

More importantly, we have received a lot of **great connections** who are interested in the app and also are **willing to provide us support** in our application development.

Thank you, my amazing team, **Jessica, Kristen, and Sreeram**! I look forward to working with all of you to make this app a reality!
