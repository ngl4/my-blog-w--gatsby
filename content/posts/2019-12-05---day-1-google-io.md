## Unexpected Beginning of the Day

I caught the earliest i/o shuttle bus in San Francisco with my roommate, Dicko Sow. On the way to Mountain View, I and Dicko had discussion about jobs, interview, as well as their related challenges. Half way through our conversation, a man sat in front of us turned to us. I was a little nervous thinking we might be too loud on the bus, but unexpectedly, he said he overheard our conversation and would like to offer to help us out if we need any advice in our career path. He is **Joseph Burke, a Senior Software Engineer at Wework**. 

He shared with us his thought and advice on women salary negotiation, 80/20 rule (80% of the available jobs are not posted online), and the matter of clean code. He even suggested me to read this book, **"Clean Code" by Robert Cecil Martin**, which is extremely helpful to understand how to write clean codes when working through projects and coding challenges. [Here](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-write-clean-code-d557d998bb08) is one other resource I found might be helpful for whoever is interested. 

One more thing I would like to share. Before he got off the bus, he mentioned the importance of healthy lifestyle in his life. I remember he said something similar to this: **"It takes a lot of (mental and physical) effort to be unhealthy and healthy. It is the matter of our decision, why don't we choose to take the effort to be healthy instead?"**  This has been in my head and I just want to write it down, because it is so motivational to me.
