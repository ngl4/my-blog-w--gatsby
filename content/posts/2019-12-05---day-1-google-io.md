# Unexpected Beginning of the Day

I caught the earliest i/o shuttle bus in San Francisco with my roommate, Dicko Sow. On the way to Mountain View, I and Dicko had discussion about jobs, interview, as well as their related challenges. Half way through our conversation, a man sat in front of us turned to us. I was a little nervous thinking we might be too loud on the bus, but unexpectedly, he said he overheard our conversation and would like to offer to help us out if we need any advice in our career path. He is **Joseph Burke, a Senior Software Engineer at Wework**. 

He shared with us his thought and advice on women salary negotiation, 80/20 rule (80% of the available jobs are not posted online), and the matter of clean code. He even suggested me to read this book, **"[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)" by Robert Cecil Martin**, which is extremely helpful to understand how to write clean codes when working through projects and coding challenges. [Here](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-write-clean-code-d557d998bb08) is one other resource I found might be helpful for whoever is interested.

One more thing I would like to share. Before he got off the bus, he mentioned the importance of healthy lifestyle in his life. I remember he said something similar to this: **"It takes a lot of (mental and physical) effort to be unhealthy and healthy. It is the matter of our decision, why don't we choose to take the effort to be healthy instead?"**  This has been in my head and I just want to write it down, because it is so motivational to me. 

# Keynotes and Sessions 

Since for most keynotes and sessions, you can definitely watch them online on Youtube. I will briefly list out those I had attended: 

<!-- What sparks you at each session and what is your key takeaways from them-->

Before I went to some sessions, I got the chance to talk to Badsha Das, Founder of 8d Tech. He told me about a great resource if I would like to learn more about Android development in the future. [Here](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-beast-android-developer-firebase-necessities/) is the Udemy course for intermediate Android developers.

# Inspirational Encounter @ Codelabs

After going through the sessions, I decided to take a break at Codelabs and do some coding. Basically, you would be working on differnet small step-by-step tutorials to build and understand certain coding languages or frameworks at Codelabs. There will be Google employees there to assist you if you need help or have questions. After setting up my laptop and phone, I noticed an attendee sat next to me going through codelabs pretty fast. I then asked the attendee some questions and basically we ended up talking for a long period of time on Augmented Reality. 

This attendee is **Tetsuya Tano, who is a Chief R&D Engineer at [Sumanobe!](https://sumanobe.imjp.co.jp/en/) @ [IMJ Corporation](https://www.imjp.co.jp/en/) located in Tokyo, Japan**. Tetsuya showed me a lot of his works and explained to me how he built them. His passion and works inspired me, especially the different approach he took in building AR applications. I feel extremely grateful for his support and guidance. I have learned a lot from him and would like to start building apps as soon as I left the conference.

# The Unbelievable Evening

During the After Dark, I went to get some foods and had a look around the arcade performance. They were pretty stunning. 

![io-after-dark-1](/media/google-io-2019/io-after-dark-1.jpg) 

Then, during the After Dark events, I was super super excited that I had met **Varsha Venkatesh (App Lead @ Wayfair), Richard Laskey (Senior Software Engineer @ Wayfair), and five others Wayfair employees**. I had a longer conversation with Varsha about **Wayfair** application process. She let me know what I need to do to join the AR team. After conversing and interacting with them in person, I like the people and the culture even more than before. This time for sure, I see my way even clearer than before. I know that is the **way** to go. *(By the way, Special thanks to Priya Shah for letting me know about Varsha through Slack and that is how I could reach out to her and meet up with her in person.)*

After meeting with Wayfair employees, I went through the Arcade again and had a look around. There were lots of **fun games and activities**.

# Key Takeaways

### 1. Expect the Unexpectation - Who is sitting next to you? 

  Whenever and wherever you are, have you ever thought about talking to the person/people sitting next to/around you? It can be awkward to start a conversation, but remember that awkwardness is only there temporarily. Getting to know a new friend is as if you are openning up a new door. Awkwardness is crucial a barrier preventing you to open a closest new door next to/around you. Sometimes, it is good to take a deep breath first and then try to open that door. I can tell you that, you will always find something new, something unexpected, something different, something might be familiar, but defintely not something expected. 

### 2. Take Action to Get to Your Dream - One step at a time

  Each of us will have different directions in life. It is super important to keep working toward that dream, goal, or future vision, a step at a time. If you attended a conference and knew someone worked at your favourite company was also there, reach out to them. If you knew the company had some webinar events, signed up for them. You want to make sure that what you like, dream, vision is not an illusion. Meeting the company's employees in-person can always give you a better idea of who they are and whether you are a good match for them.
