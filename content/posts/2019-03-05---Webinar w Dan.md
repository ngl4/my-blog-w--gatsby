Today, through my bootcamp Career Services, I got the chance to attended the webinar panel to get to learn more about an Amazon Software Engineer Manager, Dan Monahan. I just want to note down some key points that he mentioned in the panel: 

1. **Have you failed enough?** -- *"We expect failure...(and) we are not failing enough* -- Basically it is important to not think about failure as actual failure. Maybe you have not failed enough to find the correct answer. Don't ever close your door to failure. Welcome it! 

2. **Don't Know an Anwer to an Interview Question?** -- *then just say you don't know, it is ok to say that* -- to add on to this myself, I would say maybe give it a try to talk about what you think it might be, though it could be wrong. At least you give it a try. This includes some guessing and some reasoning. 

3. **How to make you memorable in the interview process** -- *Be yourself - be who you are - (know how to) address technical problems and how you handle those problems* -- Express your passion in your work will be an excellent way to make them memorable. Your work tells who you are. 

4. **Potential Teammate - who are they choosing?** -- *(based on) personality fit. A lot of big companies, like Amazon, Google, or Facebook, etc, are looking for candidates who are expected to (adapt) work at any teams within the companies* -- Being able to adapt and learn quickly are the keys. 


***Questions to think about: Is "Interview for Sports" is a good thing to do for practicing behavior/technical interview?***
